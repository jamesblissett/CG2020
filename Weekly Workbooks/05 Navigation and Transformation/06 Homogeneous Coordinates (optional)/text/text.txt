This is an optional task that you may (or may not ?) wish to implement. It is useful to know about homogenous coordinates - so _do_ view the slides and audio narration above. However, it is up to you whether you choose to implement these in your rendering code at this point in time. They are not essential to complete the exercises and they offer only very marginal benefit for the kinds of rendering that we will be attempting in the remainder of this unit.

If you have the time (and the desire to do so) refactor your code to operate with homogenous coordinates. This will require you to replace _vec3_ variables with _vec4_ and _mat3_ with _mat4_. You may also find that you get some interesting "bonus features" and "side effects" with features such as _LookAt_ !
