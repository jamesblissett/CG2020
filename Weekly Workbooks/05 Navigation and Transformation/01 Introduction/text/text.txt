This workbook continues on from where we left off last week, by implementing additional features to the rasterising renderer. We start by adding texture mapping to the existing renderer. Finally we make the whole thing interactive (so that the user can navigate through the model). If you didn't complete all of last week's tasks, you should finish these first before starting on this week's workbook.
