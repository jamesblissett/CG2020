The aim of this task is to integrate the texture mapping function that you implemented in a previous workbook into your 3D rasteriser. Rather than drawing the floor of the Cornell Box model as two plain green triangles, you should texture these triangles using our usual <a href="models/texture.ppm" target="_blank">texture image</a>.

Take a look at the slides and audio narration above for more information on how OBJ files handle texture information. Use this knowledge to extend your file parsing function to read and then store the additional texture information. Note that the `ModelTriangle` class contains an array of `TexturePoints` to help you maintain the relationship between triangle vertices and texture point coordinates.

To help you in this task, we have provided an <a href="models/textured-cornell-box.mtl" target="_blank">updated OBJ materials file</a> and an <a href="models/textured-cornell-box.obj" target="_blank">updated OBJ geometry file</a> both of which contain additional texture information (namely a new textured material called "Cobbles", texture mapping points for some of the vertices and a reference to the texture image file).

When implemented correctly, you should end up with a Cornell Box with the textured floor, similar to that shown in the diagram below.
