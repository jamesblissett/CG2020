It soon becomes a pain to have to manually move the camera around the scene using the keyboard each time we want to get a different perspective on a model. To ease this problem (and to make testing of your rendered easier) we will now include some additional code that automatically animates the position of your camera. More specifically, add some code to rotate (orbit) the position on the camera (in the Y axis) about the centre of the Cornell Box. This will involve applying a small rotation transformation to the camera position vector every time the `update` function is called.

The problem with the above feature is that you will soon lose sight of the model (because, although the camera position is rotating, it will always be looking off in the same direction !). To avoid this issue, implement a `lookAt` function as described in the above slides and audio narration. This will ensure that the camera is always oriented towards the centre of the scene, so that the Cornell Box room will always be visible. Call this `lookAt` function from your `update` method every time you shift the position of the camera.
