Write a new `draw` function that renders the Cornell Box model using the closest intersection algorithm. Don't throw away your old rasterising draw function - you are going to need this later !

In your new draw function, you should loop through each pixel on the image plane (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), casting a ray from the camera, through the current pixel and into the scene. You should determine if this ray intersects with a triangle from the model and, when it does, shade the image plane pixel with the colour of the closest intersected triangle.
