Rasterising is a fast and efficient approach to rendering a 3 dimensional scene. However, it has limitations it that there are a number of phenomena that are difficult (or impossible) to achieve using this approach. In particular, calculating light and shadow is not well suited to rasterising. For this reason, we now turn our attention to an alternative form of rendering, namely _ray tracing_. Take a look at the slides, audio narration and animation linked to above in order to gain a high-level understanding of the operation of ray tracing. Once you have grasped the basic concepts, move on to the tasks in the remainder of this workbook.

It is advisable to continue working with your current project and augment it with additional ray tracing functions. This will not only allow you to switch between different rendering models (wireframe, rasterised, ray-traced) but will also permit "hybrid" rendering to take place (don't worry what this means yet - we will discuss it in more detail later).
